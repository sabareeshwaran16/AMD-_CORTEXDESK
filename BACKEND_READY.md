# ✅ CONNECTED TO LEGACY BACKEND

Your backend is already running on **port 8001**!

## Current Setup

✅ Backend: http://localhost:8001 (RUNNING)
⏳ Frontend: Need to start

## Next Step - Start Frontend

Open a **NEW terminal** and run:

```bash
cd desktop
npm run dev
```

Wait for:
```
Local: http://localhost:5173
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:5173**

## What I Fixed

✅ Updated frontend to connect to port **8001** (your running backend)
✅ Adapted API calls to work with legacy backend endpoints
✅ Fixed file upload to work with single-file endpoint
✅ Updated health check and search endpoints

---

## Your Backend is Ready!

Keep this terminal running:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8001
```

Just start the frontend now and you're good to go! 🚀
